# Schematics
Create Mod Schematics by AgentPenguinC

Note: All schematics may be slightly corrupted, thanks to the Create Mod's schematic system. Rotation of blocks or other NBT data may be incorrect, and need adjusting with a Debug Stick to Function. Also, in order to use any linked controllers or redstone links on Valkyrien Skies: Tournament contraptions, make sure to edit the Create Mod config by going to Configure -> Gameplay Settings -> Logistics -> Link Range, and set it to 99999999. This is not necessary for builds in VS: Clockwork. Check this video on a more detailed explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMNtFEYBSk

### Clockwork Fighter Plane
- Schematic Name: fighter_clockwork_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Clockwork (Latest nightly in the clockwork-nightlies channel here: https://discord.gg/gmcn33deRz), Create: Big Cannons (Latest Nightly Here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create: Alloyed, Create: Deco, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor

### Attack Helicopter
- Schematic Name: atk_heli_6.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge OR Fabric
- Mods Required: Create 0.5.0, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Clockwork (Latest nightly in the clockwork-nightlies channel here: https://discord.gg/gmcn33deRz), Create: Big Cannons (Latest Nightly Here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create: Alloyed, Create: Deco, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor
- Additional Notes:
  - Some redstone links may be broken, especially ones on the front and back propellors.
  - You need to glue the front upper flap section (below the autocannons) on each side to the andesite casing block directly above it.
  - Break and replace the autocannons after assembly.
  - Right click each propellor to activate it.
  - Fill up the two fluid tanks with strawberry frosting and start the hand crank to activate the engine.
  - When flying, here are the controls:
    - Space: Activate main rotor (fly upwards/forward/backward)
    - W/S: Angle up or down. Angling upwards slows you down, and angling down generally allows you to pick up speed.
    - A/D: Turn left and right. It's helpful to press W after a turn to turn faster. Make sure to straighten yourself out, however.
    - Shift: Activate landing gear. When you're above where you want to land. Press shift once and hold down W until you land safely. Make sure to deactivate the gear once you've landed.
    - As you take off, tap S multiple times to prevent you from tipping backwards until you reach a suitable height to start moving forward.
  - If you have any questions or need help setting things up, feel free to message @agentpenguinc on discord.

- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5)
- Additional Notes:
  - The belts are purely for decoration, but may still be slightly broken in a few ways. You will also have to break and replace the belts after the drill is assembled, as belts break upon assembly.
  
### Tunnel Bore V2
- Schematic Name: tunnel_bore_v2_3.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create: Alloyed, Create: Crystal Clear, Create: Deco, Create: Crafts and Additions, Create: Extended Flywheels, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor
- Additional Notes:
  - You will have to place belts on the shafts behind the wheels on assembly.
  - Some, if not all chain drives will be broken. There is nothing I can do about this.
  - Some redstone links may be broken.
  - The orientation of some objects like thrusters may be off, right click them with a debug stick until they look right.
  
### Bomber Plane
- Schematic Name: f_b_plane_1.nbt 
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT)
- Additional Notes:
  - In order for the propellors to work, you must destroy them, place a debug hinge in their place, right click it, and then rebuild them.
  - In order for the cannons to work, you must destroy and rebuild them. Make sure to put ammo in the hoppers.

### Tank
- Schematic Name: penguintank_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create Alloyed, and Create Crystal Clear. [RECOMMENDED] Personality (it helps with getting around the tank)
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild the main cannon before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some components such as redstone links or sequenced gearshift instructions make break upon assembly, i'm not sure why but this schematic is especially finicky.
  
### Missile Truck
- Schematic Name: missile_truck_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create Alloyed, Create Crystal Clear, Create Extended Flywheels, and Create Crafts and Additions.
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Upon assembling the truck, you will have to glue the back of the truck together again, because glue does not carry over upon assembling ships.

### Dreadnought
- Schematic Name: dreadnought_6.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create: Big Cannons, Create: Alloyed, Create: Crystal Clear, Create: Deco, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot them, or they will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some logical parts of the ship may break upon assembly, such as the automatic reloading logic. If this happens, paste another schematic into your world of the ship and try replacing the broken parts on the assembled ship with their equivalents on the unassembled one.
  - You will have to replace the belts on the sides of the ship once it is assembled, as they will be glitched.
