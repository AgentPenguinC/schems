# Schematics
Create Mod Schematics by AgentPenguinC

Note: All schematics use my Modpack: "AgentPenguinC's Clockwork Pack". It is a zip file, and does NOT contain the mods you need to use my builds. It is a curseforge modpack zip, which means you need to use the Curseforge Launcher or Prism Launcher to use them. See this video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPyAjmrpmpU

### Clockwork Fighter Plane
- Schematic Name: fighter_clockwork_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - All other assembly steps are in the related video. Have fun!
 
### Attack Helicopter
- Schematic Name: atk_heli_6.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge OR Fabric
- Additional Notes:
  - Some redstone links may be broken, especially ones on the front and back propellors.
  - You need to glue the front upper flap section (below the autocannons) on each side to the andesite casing block directly above it.
  - Break and replace the autocannons after assembly.
  - Right click each propellor to activate it.
  - Fill up the two fluid tanks with strawberry frosting and start the hand crank to activate the engine.
  - When flying, here are the controls:
    - Space: Activate main rotor (fly upwards/forward/backward)
    - W/S: Angle up or down. Angling upwards slows you down, and angling down generally allows you to pick up speed.
    - A/D: Turn left and right. It's helpful to press W after a turn to turn faster. Make sure to straighten yourself out, however.
    - Shift: Activate landing gear. When you're above where you want to land. Press shift once and hold down W until you land safely. Make sure to deactivate the gear once you've landed.
    - As you take off, tap S multiple times to prevent you from tipping backwards until you reach a suitable height to start moving forward.
  - If you have any questions or need help setting things up, feel free to message @agentpenguinc on discord.
 
### Clockwork Tank Tutorial
- Full Tank:
  - Schematic Name: chinchilla_mk2_2.nbt
  - Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Armorless Tank:
  - Schematic Name: chinchillainnards1.nbt
  - Version: 1.18.2 Forge

### Tunnel Bore V1
- Schematic Name: drill3.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5)
- Additional Notes:
  - The belts are purely for decoration, but may still be slightly broken in a few ways. You will also have to break and replace the belts after the drill is assembled, as belts break upon assembly.
  
### Tunnel Bore V2
- Schematic Name: tunnel_bore_v2_3.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - You will have to place belts on the shafts behind the wheels on assembly.
  - Some, if not all chain drives will be broken. There is nothing I can do about this.
  - Some redstone links may be broken.
  - The orientation of some objects like thrusters may be off, right click them with a debug stick until they look right.
  
### Bomber Plane
- Schematic Name: f_b_plane_1.nbt 
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - In order for the propellors to work, you must destroy them, place a debug hinge in their place, right click it, and then rebuild them.
  - In order for the cannons to work, you must destroy and rebuild them. Make sure to put ammo in the hoppers.

### Tank
- Schematic Name: penguintank_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild the main cannon before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some components such as redstone links or sequenced gearshift instructions make break upon assembly, i'm not sure why but this schematic is especially finicky.
  
### Missile Truck
- Schematic Name: missile_truck_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Upon assembling the truck, you will have to glue the back of the truck together again, because glue does not carry over upon assembling ships.

### Dreadnought
- Schematic Name: dreadnought_6.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot them, or they will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some logical parts of the ship may break upon assembly, such as the automatic reloading logic. If this happens, paste another schematic into your world of the ship and try replacing the broken parts on the assembled ship with their equivalents on the unassembled one.
  - You will have to replace the belts on the sides of the ship once it is assembled, as they will be glitched.
