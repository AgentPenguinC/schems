# Schematics
Create Mod Schematics by AgentPenguinC

Note: All schematics may be slightly corrupted, thanks to the Create Mod's schematic system. Rotation of blocks or other NBT data may be incorrect, and need adjusting with a Debug Stick to Function. Also, in order to use any linked controllers or redstone links on Valkyrien Skies contraptions, make sure to edit the Create Mod config by going to Configure -> Gameplay Settings -> Logistics -> Link Range, and set it to 99999999.
