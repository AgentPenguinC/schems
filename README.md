# Schematics
Create Mod Schematics by AgentPenguinC

Note: All schematics may be slightly corrupted, thanks to the Create Mod's schematic system. Rotation of blocks or other NBT data may be incorrect, and need adjusting with a Debug Stick to Function. Also, in order to use any linked controllers or redstone links on Valkyrien Skies contraptions, make sure to edit the Create Mod config by going to Configure -> Gameplay Settings -> Logistics -> Link Range, and set it to 99999999.

- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5)
- Additional Notes:
  - The belts are purely for decoration, but may still be slightly broken in a few ways. You will also have to break and replace the belts after the drill is assembled, as belts break upon assembly.
  
### Tunnel Bore V2
- Schematic Name: tunnel_bore_v2_3.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create: Alloyed, Create: Crystal Clear, Create: Deco, Create: Crafts and Additions, Create: Extended Flywheels, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor
- Additional Notes:
  - You will have to place belts on the shafts behind the wheels on assembly.
  - Some, if not all chain drives will be broken. There is nothing I can do about this.
  - Some redstone links may be broken.
  - The orientation of some objects like thrusters may be off, right click them with a debug stick until they look right.
  
### Bomber Plane
- Schematic Name: f_b_plane_1.nbt 
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT)
- Additional Notes:
  - In order for the propellors to work, you must destroy them, place a debug hinge in their place, right click it, and then rebuild them.
  - In order for the cannons to work, you must destroy and rebuild them. Make sure to put ammo in the hoppers.

### Tank
- Schematic Name: penguintank_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create Alloyed, and Create Crystal Clear. [RECOMMENDED] Personality (it helps with getting around the tank)
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild the main cannon before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some components such as redstone links or sequenced gearshift instructions make break upon assembly, i'm not sure why but this schematic is especially finicky.
  
### Missile Truck
- Schematic Name: missile_truck_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create Alloyed, Create Crystal Clear, Create Extended Flywheels, and Create Crafts and Additions.
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Upon assembling the truck, you will have to glue the back of the truck together again, because glue does not carry over upon assembling ships.

### Dreadnought
- Schematic Name: dreadnought_6.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create: Big Cannons, Create: Alloyed, Create: Crystal Clear, Create: Deco, Decorative Blocks, 'Dustrial Decor
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild all cannons before trying to shoot them, or they will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some logical parts of the ship may break upon assembly, such as the automatic reloading logic. If this happens, paste another schematic into your world of the ship and try replacing the broken parts on the assembled ship with their equivalents on the unassembled one.
  - You will have to replace the belts on the sides of the ship once it is assembled, as they will be glitched.
