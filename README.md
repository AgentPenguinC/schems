# Schematics
Create Mod Schematics by AgentPenguinC

Note: All schematics may be slightly corrupted, thanks to the Create Mod's schematic system. Rotation of blocks or other NBT data may be incorrect, and need adjusting with a Debug Stick to Function. Also, in order to use any linked controllers or redstone links on Valkyrien Skies contraptions, make sure to edit the Create Mod config by going to Configure -> Gameplay Settings -> Logistics -> Link Range, and set it to 99999999.

### Tunnel Bore
- Schematic Name: drill3.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5)
- Additional Notes:
  - The belts are purely for decoration, but may still be slightly broken in a few ways. You will also have to break and replace the belts after the drill is assembled, as belts break upon assembly.
  
### Bomber Plane
- Schematic Name: f_b_plane_1.nbt 
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT)
- Additional Notes:
  - In order for the propellors to work, you must destroy them, place a debug hinge in their place, right click it, and then rebuild them.
  - In order for the cannons to work, you must destroy and rebuild them. Make sure to put ammo in the hoppers.

### Tank
- Schematic Name: penguintank_5.nbt
- Version: 1.18.2 Forge
- Mods Required: Create, Valkyrien Skies, Valkyrien Skies Tournament (Latest Dev Build Here: https://github.com/ConstantDust/VS_tournament-Vintage/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3-0.5), Create Big Cannons (Get the latest nightly forge 1.18.2 build from their discord server here: https://discord.gg/vgfMMUUgvT), Create Alloyed, and Create Crystal Clear. [RECOMMENDED] Personality (it helps with getting around the tank)
- Additional Notes:
  - You must break and rebuild the main cannon before trying to shoot it, or it will assemble incorrectly.
  - Some components such as redstone links or sequenced gearshift instructions make break upon assembly, i'm not sure why but this schematic is especially finicky.
